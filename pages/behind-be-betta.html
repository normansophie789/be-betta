							<h2>The origin of the project</h2>
						</header>
						<p>This project started from a briefing given at HackCambridge101, an event we attended and competed in, held from the 18th – 19th January 2020.</p>
						<p>
							Avast (one of the sponsors of the event), offered a challenge to create an offline scroller game, which we took. We decided to have an environmental theme as we saw other sponsors really engaged with the idea of how we can use technology to combat environmental issues. 
							We decided on pollution as it is not on the forefront of the media at present but has been a constantly increasing and present issue in society. We decided to incorporate into the game issues that are hurting the ecosystem and marine life, namely: overfishing, oil spills, and plastic contamination.
						</p>
						<p>
							To make the pun complete we chose our main character to be the Thai “Betta” fish (also known as the Siamese Fighting Fish), allowing us to create this award-winning website to complement the game.

							<h2>What's Next?</h2>
						</header>
						<p>This is just a stand-in website, so the next step would be to create the fully functioning site we aimed for in our submission. We want to be able to:</p>
						<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
							<li>Host an online version of the game</li>
							<li>Host articles and links that show how we can be better and do our part</li>
							<li>Highlight the impact of pollution</li>
							<li>Recommend accredited charities and organisations who have pledged to make a difference</li>
						</ul>
						<p>We will then start to work on developing the game further, making it more accurate and adding more features. Potentially we will then start to develop this as a mobile application.</p>

						<h3>HackCambridge101</h3>
						<p>This project began in HackCambridge101, where we had 24 hours to create Be-Betta.<br> Relevant links for Be-Betta at time of submission:
							<ul>
								<li><a href="https://devpost.com/software/be-betta-ogukth">DevPost Submission</a></li>
								<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EMoeqWtJ_U">YouTube Demo Video</a></li>
								<li><a href="https://github.com/normansophie789/be-betta">GitHub repository</a></li>

						<h3>Our Mission</h3>
						<p>Playing as the Thai "Betta" fish, we hope that this game will encourage all of humanity to Be-Betta to our planet. We have successfully made a game that depicts the issues facing marine life. We are now working to successfully integrate the website to fully complement the game and its environmental ventures.</p>
